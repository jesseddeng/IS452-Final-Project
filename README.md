# IS452-Final-Project

The topic of my project will be data analysis. 

The data was from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00438/ called Health-Tweets from 16 Twitter accounts about Health News.

This project was using jupyter notebook, analyzing the top 10 high frequency words from all data.

And also doing the visulization of it.
